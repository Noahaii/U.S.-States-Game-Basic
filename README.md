# U.S.-States-Game-Basic
This code is suppose to ask user inputs for the name of a state in the U.S. and will place the name where it belongs, so long as you name a real state. 'Exit' when you want to quit or finished and if the player was not able to say all 50 states, a csv file will be generated showing in alphabetical order which stated they need to learn still.
